# GRIP_Task_6_Prediction_using_Decision_Tree_Algorithm

### Problem statement-Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

### Software used:
#### 1.python 3.9
#### 2.Jupyter Notebook/Google collab

### Libraries used:
#### 1.pandas
#### 2.sklearn

#### In this project, I have used the iris data set present in the sklearn library. Splitted the data into train and test data. USing the test data , I have created a decision tree. With the decision tree ,I have predicted the target values of test data. Builded the confusion matrix comparing the predicted and actual target values of test data set. At the end,visualized the decision tree graphically.
